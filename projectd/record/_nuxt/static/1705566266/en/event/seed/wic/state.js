It seemed clear that any movement would exacerbate his injuries.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EHe was slowly dying due to blood loss, and it seemed unlikely that even immediate medical intervention would do much to prolong his life. Moreover, the treatment could cause him even more pain.\u003Cbr\u003EAt least his face was somewhat spared, his features intact and recognizable. However, the rest of his body, from his chest area to his lower limbs, was horribly disfigured and stained with blood.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EMaybe just letting him die would be the merciful thing to do. With this thought in mind, Soy was about to walk away. But then, sensing her presence, E-Ster struggled to open his eyes. Seeing that, Soy felt a surge of compassion fill her heart. After some thought, Soy made up her mind and sent the data about the survivor to her superiors at VX.\u003Cbr\u003EUtilizing whatever resources were at hand, she did her best to stop the bleeding.

In truth, VX had wanted E-Ster's transported to their headquarters solely to use a test subject–to evaluate Soy's biomodification skills–and was not interested in keeping him alive. They didn't have much hope for his survival.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EVX had no use for E-Ster, after all.\u003Cbr\u003EWhile E-Ster lay helplessly on the operating table, his eyes slowing blinking, Soy administered painkillers and whispered,\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\"Sleep now.

Having gone through full-body biomodification, E-Ster wasn't quite ready for field missions, as he was still adapting to his new form. Therefore, he began working at Jack's pizzeria, gradually increasing the scope of his tasks while assisting Jack. Operating from Jack's pizzeria as a base, VX began to supply VX-modded Leptons to their contracted agents, utilizing E-ster as the delivery driver. These Leptons were individually loaded with unique features and were perfect for agents, as each one could freely choose and equip whatever suited their needs best.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOne of the regular customers of Jack's pizzeria was Luna.

Because Reina was a shotgun specialist, Luna's weapon of choice is the shotgun. She can also recover health through the Transfer ability, Metabolism Superdrive.
